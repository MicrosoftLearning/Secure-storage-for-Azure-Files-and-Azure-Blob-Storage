## Demonstration - Student materials and lab environment (optional)

Use this demonstration to show students how to access the lab environment and student materials. You can do this at the beginning of class or before the next demonstration. 

Show students the lab environment (adjust for your lab hoster â€“ these instructions are for Skillable)

* Discuss how students access the lab environment. 

* To sign-in to the virtual machine host, use the Resources tab to show the Administrator password.

* Once you have logged in to the virtual machine, open a browser and access the Azure portal, https://portal.azure.com. It is preferred to open the Azure portal in the lab environment instead of a separate window.

* Ask for a show of hands on how many students have used the portal.

* Search for subscription. Point out a subscription has already been configured for the lab and students should use that in the lab steps.

* Search for resource groups. Point out a resource group has already been created and should be used in the lab instructions.

* Review how the lab instructions are organized. 

Show students their course materials.

* Continue in the lab environment.

* Access the Microsoft Learn page, https://learn.microsoft.com.

* Discuss that Microsoft Learn is sole source for all Azure documentation, hands-on training, and certifications.

* Select Training and then Browse learning paths.

* Search for the Secure storage for Azure Files and Azure Blob Storage learning path.

* Discuss that the content in the learning path is specific to this assessment, but there is much more storage content they can review.

* Discuss the content is reference material and there isn't a 1:1 mapping with the classroom presentations.

* Discuss that each of these modules may have additional hands-on activities. You will identify these activities as the course progresses. 

* Discuss that if the student finds a problem with the content they can [report the issue](#_Feedback_-_Student). For example, typographical errors, sentence structure, or technical inaccuracy.

* Ask the students to bookmark the learning path.
